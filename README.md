# Star my Stuff

A small app written using AngularJS and the [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/)
framework that lets you assign star values to all of your experiences and
possessions.

Currently, there is no back-end, so data won't persist beyond the life of the app.

## Running

You'll need to install the ionic framework:

> npm install -g ionic

Then, from the project directory, run

> ionic serve

**NOTE** this is intended to be run on small form-factor devices, such as phones. If you're using Chrome, open the dev tools and select "emulation mode" to get the best picture of how the app looks.
